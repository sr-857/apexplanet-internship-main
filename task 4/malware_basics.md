Understanding Malware Analysis Methodologies

Malware analysis is the process of examining a piece of malicious code to understand its purpose, functionality, and potential impact. Analysts typically combine two approaches:

Static Analysis (Looking at the Code)
Concept: This is the passive examination of a file without ever executing it. It's like reviewing a blueprint without building the house.
Methodology Focus: Identifying key characteristics and potential behavior.
Key Techniques:
File Hashing: Calculating the file's cryptographic hash (MD5, SHA-256) to check databases (like VirusTotal) for known threats.
String Extraction: Pulling readable text strings from the executable (e.g., API calls, filenames, URLs, error messages) to reveal its intent.
Header Analysis: Examining the file header (PE header for Windows) to identify dependencies (DLLs), compilation time, and compiler used.

Dynamic Analysis (Running the Code)
Concept: This is the active execution of the malware in a safe, isolated sandbox environment. It's observing the house being built to see what materials it uses and what damage it causes.
Methodology Focus: Observing the live interactions with the operating system and network.
Key Techniques:
System Monitoring: Using tools (like Process Monitor) to track changes the malware makes to the file system and registry (e.g., creating new files, establishing persistence).
Network Capture: Using tools (like Wireshark) to monitor all network traffic generated by the malware (e.g., C2 server communication, data exfiltration attempts).
Behavioral Tracing: Observing the code's high-level actions, such as trying to spread, encrypt files, or steal information.

Conceptual Analysis in a Sandbox Environment

For this task, a benign sample (a non-malicious file with known behavior) is analyzed in a controlled sandbox (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox or a simple isolated VM) to demonstrate the dynamic analysis process.

A. Sandbox Setup
The analysis is performed within an environment completely isolated from the main network to prevent any accidental spread or damage. The environment must include:
A monitoring host (our Kali machine).
A fully isolated guest machine (the sandbox) with monitoring tools installed.
The system state (file system, registry) is snapshotted before execution.

B. Conceptual Dynamic Analysis Steps
Monitor Execution: The benign sample is executed within the sandbox.
File System Monitoring: We track any changes. For example, a benign application might create a log file or modify an application setting in the user's local directory. We check for suspicious activity, such as attempts to modify core system files or delete backups.
Network Monitoring: We monitor network traffic to see what the application connects to. A benign application might connect to an update server or its main domain. We look for suspicious activity, such as connections to known malicious IP addresses or attempts to use uncommon ports.
Behavioral Analysis: We document the application's entire run-time behavior. For instance, if the application is supposed to be a media player, we confirm it only accesses media files and doesn't try to access the password manager's registry keys.
