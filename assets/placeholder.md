# Screenshot Placeholders

This directory is for storing screenshots that will be displayed in the README.

## How to Add Your Screenshots

1. Replace the following files with your actual screenshots:
   - `nmap-scan.png` - Screenshot of Nmap scan results
   - `burp-suite.png` - Screenshot of Burp Suite interface
   - `metasploit.png` - Screenshot of Metasploit console

2. Make sure to maintain the same filenames as referenced in the README.

3. The images should be in PNG format for best quality.

## Recommended Screenshot Sizes
- Width: 800-1200px
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- File size: Keep under 500KB per image

## Naming Convention
Use descriptive names with hyphens, for example:
- `nmap-scan-results.png`
- `burp-suite-intercept.png`
- `metasploit-exploit.png`

## Updating README
After adding your screenshots, update the image paths in the README.md file if you've used different filenames.
