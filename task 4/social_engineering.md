Social Engineering: Phishing Simulation & Awareness Training

Phishing Simulation Page

A mock phishing page (`phishing_login.html`) was created to simulate a common account verification scam. This page was designed to visually mimic a legitimate corporate login portal, prompting users to re-enter their credentials.

A mock phishing page (phishing_login.html) was created to simulate a common, real-world credential harvesting attack.

The page was designed to visually mimic a generic corporate or email login portal (e.g., "ApexCorp Account Login"). The primary psychological technique employed is Urgency and Fear of Loss, conveyed through the message, "Your session has expired. Please re-enter your credentials to verify your account." This message prompts the user to bypass critical thinking and input their credentials immediately.

The simulation page contains standard input fields for Username/Email and Password, and a "Log In" button. For ethical demonstration, the form is non-functional; clicking the login button triggers a JavaScript alert box instead of sending data to an external server. This structure effectively demonstrates the attack's visual deception without posing any actual threat.

Phishing Awareness Training

Effective security hinges on user education. The following points highlight key indicators and best practices to train users in detecting and preventing phishing attacks:

1.  **Check the URL Carefully:**
    * **Training:** Always hover over (but don't click!) any links to see the true destination. Ensure the domain name (e.g., `google.com`, `bankofamerica.com`) is correct, not a slight misspelling (`g00gle.com`, `bank0famerica.com`).
    * **Example (from simulation):** A real phishing email might link to `apexcorp-verify.ru` instead of `login.apexcorp.com`.
2.  **Look for Spelling & Grammatical Errors:**
    * **Training:** Phishing emails often contain numerous typos and poor grammar, which are red flags for illegitimate communication.
3.  **Beware of Urgency & Threats:**
    * **Training:** Phishing attacks frequently create a sense of panic or urgency ("Your account will be suspended!", "Immediate action required!") to pressure users into acting without thinking.
4.  **Verify Sender's Email Address:**
    * **Training:** Check the full sender's email address, not just the display name. Attackers can spoof display names. Look for mismatches with official company domains.
5.  **Never Share Credentials Directly:**
    * **Training:** Legitimate organizations will rarely ask for your password directly via email or through a link. If unsure, navigate directly to the official website instead of clicking links.
6.  **Report Suspicious Emails:**
    * **Training:** Establish a clear process for reporting suspicious emails to the IT/Security team. "When in doubt, report it out!"

This awareness training aims to empower users to become the first line of defense against social engineering tactics.
